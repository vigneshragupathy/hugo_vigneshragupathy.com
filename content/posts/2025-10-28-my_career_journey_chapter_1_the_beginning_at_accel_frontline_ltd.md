> 💭 *This is part of my [career journey series](../my-career-journey-looking-back-at-the-path-so-far) — a personal reflection on the people, experiences, and moments that shaped my path. This isn't a résumé or professional summary; it's simply me looking back and sharing the stories that mattered along the way.*

**📍 Nov 2010 – Nov 2012 | Chennai**

Fresh out of college, I began my career at **Accel Frontline Ltd** in Chennai.

It was my first step into the world of IT — and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to start.

I joined the **Hosting Team** , a small group of six, responsible for everything from **email (qmail, sendmail, postfix, zimbra)** and **web hosting** to **VPC environments** . It was a hands-on role in every sense — we managed not only the hosting but also the underlying infrastructure.

I learned to assemble servers from scratch — adding hard drives, configuring hardware RAID, setting up network switches, and mounting machines in racks at the data center. Sometimes we even had to ship hardware ourselves. There was no “this isn’t my job” mindset; we all pitched in and learned together.

What I loved most was the **culture of curiosity** . Everyone was willing to teach, help, and share. We often stayed late troubleshooting issues, laughing over snacks, and feeling that shared pride when everything finally worked.

### 💸 The Struggles Behind the Learning

I worked at Accel for almost **two years** , and while the learning was priceless, the financial side was quite the opposite.

My salary was **₹1.2 lakh per annum** — which came to about **₹8,300 per month** take-home. Out of that, I had to manage everything — shared rent (a 1BHK apartment with **five others** ), internet bills, mobile bills, food, and daily travel to the office. It was tough — every rupee mattered.

To make things trickier, we had a **three-year contract** , and breaking it meant paying a **₹1.5 lakh penalty** — ironically, more than my annual salary.

On top of that, Accel was going through **financial challenges** at the time, as it was in the middle of an **acquisition phase** .

That meant salary delays — sometimes by **two weeks** , and occasionally, an entire **month’s pay would be skipped** and merged with the next one.

Imagine trying to stretch ₹8,000 while waiting for delayed pay — it taught me budgeting the hard way.

And as if that wasn’t enough, we also worked **six days a week** , including **every Saturday**.

So between work, travel, and managing expenses, there wasn’t really much of a “life outside work.”

Most weekends were spent either catching up on sleep or preparing for the next week — but in hindsight, it built discipline and endurance that would help me later in my career.

Despite the challenges, those years built my **resilience** . They made me appreciate the value of stability, planning, and knowing when to take the next step.

So, with a mix of anxiety and hope, I decided it was time to look for opportunities outside.

I had one clear goal in mind — to find a job with a salary good enough to help me **break the contract** and move forward.

### ✨ What I Learned at Accel Frontline

* **Hands-on learning** beats theory every single time.
* **Teamwork** matters more than titles.
* **Financial struggles** can become powerful motivation
* **Curiosity and willingness** to experiment build the strongest foundation.
