For over a decade, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work across different organizations, meet amazing people, and grow through experiences that shaped both my career and my personality.

This post isnâ€™t a rÃ©sumÃ© or a professional summary â€” itâ€™s more of a **personal reflection** . A place to look back, remember where it all started, and appreciate the people, culture, and moments that made this journey meaningful.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve moved across cities â€” from **Chennai to Bangalore to Navi Mumbai** , and then back to **Bangalore (remote)** â€” each phase bringing its own flavor of learning, friendships, and memories.

I wanted to capture those stories here â€” not as bullet points on a CV, but as small chapters of my life in tech.

This blog is for **me** â€” a digital scrapbook of sorts â€” to look back someday and smile at how far Iâ€™ve come.

> âœ¨ Each chapter below will explore a different phase of my journey â€” not just what I did, but who I became along the way.

ðŸ“· Iâ€™ll also be adding a few photos and memories from each chapter â€” because itâ€™s not just about work, itâ€™s about the people and moments that made it all worthwhile.
