# Moving Back to Bangalore â€“ A New Chapter After 4 Years of WFH

After more than **four years of working from home** , itâ€™s finally time for a big change. This November, weâ€™ll be **relocating to Bangalore** as part of the return-to-office transition.

It feels a bit surreal when I think about it â€” I joined **Sage** during the fully remote days and have hardly been to the office. In fact, Iâ€™ve only visited twice â€” once for the **AWS hackathon** and another time to meet the **leadership team** . The rest of my journey so far has been from my little home setup.

For the last **one and a half years** , weâ€™ve been in **Chennai** , and itâ€™s been nothing short of wonderful. We absolutely love this city â€” the warm people, our friendly neighbours, and especially our **weekend car trips** ({{< newtabref  href="https://vigneshragupathy.com/the-long-road-of-parenthood/" title="I even wrote earlier about how those drives brought our family closer" >}}). From **ECR** to **Mahabalipuram** , beaches to mountains â€” every weekend felt like a mini vacation.

What makes leaving Chennai even harder is my sonâ€™s **school** . For the first time, he truly loves going to school â€” and convincing him to move to a new one feels like the toughest part of this transition.

That said, **Bangalore isnâ€™t a new city for us** . Before COVID, me and my wife spent some wonderful years there, and weâ€™re looking forward to reliving those moments â€” the **cool weather** , the **cafes** , and of course, catching up with old friends.

Thereâ€™s excitement, but also a bit of worry â€” new schools, **extra expenses** , **traffic** , and **longer commutes** . But change is part of growth, and as a family, weâ€™ve learned to embrace it together.

Hereâ€™s to a **new chapter in Bangalore** , new memories, and hopefully, many more weekend road trips ahead. ðŸš—âœ¨
