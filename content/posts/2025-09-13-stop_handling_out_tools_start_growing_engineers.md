# Stop Handing Out Tools. Start Growing Engineers

I’ve seen this happen too many times. A new project kicks off, and the team hears:

> *“Here’s the tool. Here’s the plan. Just deploy.”*

It feels efficient. But it skips the most important step: **exploration.**

When engineers are told what to use, they don’t learn *why* . They never see how others solve the same problem. They miss the chance to break, test, and truly understand. And over time, they stay stuck—good executors, but not real decision-makers.

I believe every project needs an **Exploration/Hacking Phase.** A time before design and implementation where engineers get space to:

* Try different tools.
* Hack, test, and compare.
* Understand complexity and trade-offs.
* Bring back real insights.

Here’s how it works best:

* Everyone explores **individually** (to avoid bias).
* Then the team comes together, shares notes, challenges assumptions.
* Finally, design happens—not on slides, but on evidence.

Most organizations skip this because of time pressure. They want speed. But here’s the irony: skipping exploration usually makes things slower. Rollouts stumble on hidden issues, designs need rework, and production throws surprises.

The healthiest projects I’ve seen follow four phases:

1. **Exploration** – learn, test, experiment.
2. **Design** – share findings, align, finalize.
3. **Implementation** – build with confidence.
4. **Operations** – run, monitor, improve.

Exploration looks like slowing down. But it’s the opposite. It’s what makes the rest of the journey faster, smoother, and smarter.

**Skip it, and you’ll pay later.**
