**📍 Nov 2010 – Nov 2012 | Chennai**

Fresh out of college, I began my career at **Accel Frontline Ltd** in Chennai.

It was my first step into the world of IT — and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to start.

I joined the **Hosting Team** , a small group of six, responsible for everything from **email (qmail, sendmail, postfix, zimbra)** and **web hosting** to **VPC environments** . It was a hands-on role in every sense — we managed not only the hosting but also the underlying infrastructure.

I learned to assemble servers from scratch — adding hard drives, configuring hardware RAID, setting up network switches, and mounting machines in racks at the data center. Sometimes we even had to ship hardware ourselves. There was no “this isn’t my job” mindset; we all pitched in and learned together.

What I loved most was the **culture of curiosity** . Everyone was willing to teach, help, and share. We often stayed late troubleshooting issues, laughing over snacks, and feeling that shared pride when everything finally worked.

### ✨ What I Learned at Accel Frontline

* **Hands-on learning** beats theory every single time.
* **Teamwork** matters more than titles.
* Curiosity and willingness to experiment build the strongest foundation.
